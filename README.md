# Skill-Gap-Analysis-Tool
This script employs TF-IDF vectorization and K-Means clustering to categorize intern skill sets and identify technical deficiencies relative to specific job roles. It generates a detailed "Action Plan" and visualizes these gaps using Seaborn to help candidates prioritize the training needed for their target careers.
This sophisticated analytical engine is designed to quantify the alignment between current talent capabilities and evolving industry demands. By utilizing a data-driven framework, the tool ingest raw intern skill data and processes it through TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. This NLP technique transforms qualitative skill descriptions into high-dimensional numerical vectors, allowing the system to determine the relative importance of specific technologies—such as Python, SQL, or TensorFlow—within a candidate's portfolio compared to a broader job market corpus.

To provide organizational structure to diverse talent pools, the script implements K-Means Clustering. This unsupervised machine learning algorithm groups candidates into distinct "talent clusters" based on their shared technical competencies. By categorizing interns into specialized cohorts, HR professionals and career counselors can gain a high-level overview of their workforce's strengths, identifying which groups are best suited for roles in Data Science, Web Development, or Product Management. This automated segmentation eliminates manual sorting and highlights the natural distribution of expertise within the applicant pool.

The core utility of the system lies in its rigorous Skill Gap Analysis logic. By cross-referencing a candidate's proficiency-mapped skills against the mandatory requirements of specific job roles, the script identifies critical "shortfalls." The algorithm does not merely look for keyword matches; it filters for a minimum competency threshold (e.g., intermediate or advanced) to ensure that only viable skills are counted. The output is a structured roadmap that explicitly lists missing technologies and provides tailored Training Recommendations, transforming raw data into an actionable professional development plan.

To enhance decision-making, the tool integrates an advanced visualization suite using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The system generates frequency distributions of talent clusters and comparative bar charts that illustrate the magnitude of skill gaps across different candidates and roles. These visual insights allow stakeholders to quickly identify which roles are the most difficult to fill and which interns are closest to being "job-ready." The final results are exported as a standardized CSV file, providing a portable, auditable trail of talent assessment data for integration into larger Human Capital Management (HCM) systems.
